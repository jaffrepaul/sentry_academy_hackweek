# Sentry Academy Product Brief

## Project Overview / Description

Sentry Academy is a feature adoption engine disguised as a learning platform experience. The platform strategically guides current Sentry users beyond basic error tracking to discover and implement advanced features, ultimately accelerating their time-to-value and increasing product adoption. Through interactive learning paths and comprehensive course content, users will discover the full potential of Sentry's ecosystem while improving their error monitoring setups and development practices.

## Target Audience

### Primary Audience

- **Current Sentry Users** who primarily use error tracking and are unsure what to implement next
- Users who have basic error monitoring set up but haven't explored Sentry's full feature set
- Development teams looking to optimize their error monitoring and observability practices

### Secondary Audience

- **New Sentry Users** starting from scratch who need guided onboarding
- Developers seeking best practices for error monitoring and application observability
- Teams evaluating Sentry's capabilities beyond basic error tracking

## Primary Benefits / Features

### Core Learning Experience

- **Interactive Learning Paths**: Role-based recommendations that suggest the "next feature" to enable after basic error tracking
- **Comprehensive Course Library**: Traditional Ã  la carte course cards covering specific integrations and features
- **Hands-on Practice**: Demo repositories users can fork to practice implementing features in real environments

### Content Structure (Per Course/Feature)

- **Intro Video**: Visual overview of the feature and its benefits
- **Feature Description**: Clear explanation of what the feature does and why it matters
- **Key Takeaways**: Bulleted highlights of primary benefits
- **Real-world Scenarios**: Practical use cases demonstrating when and why to use the feature
- **Implementation Code**: Step-by-step code examples showing how to enable the feature
- **Social Proof**: Case studies and pull quotes from high-profile customers
- **Sentry UI Examples**: Screenshots and walkthroughs of what the enabled feature looks like in the Sentry interface

### Strategic Objectives

- Reduce time-to-value for new Sentry features
- Increase adoption of specific integrations (Performance Monitoring, Session Replay, etc.)
- Improve error monitoring setup quality and completeness
- Encourage development best practices and proper observability implementation

## High-level Tech/Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

- **React + TypeScript**: Modern component-based UI built with Vite for fast development
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling for consistent, responsive design
- **Component Library**: Reusable UI components for courses, learning paths, and content display

### Content Management

- **Structured Content Models**: Standardized templates for course content including videos, code snippets, and examples
- **Progressive Learning Paths**: Algorithm-driven recommendations based on user role and current Sentry configuration
- **Integration Tracking**: Ability to detect and recommend next steps based on user's existing Sentry setup

### Key Features

- **Role-based Onboarding**: Tailored learning paths for Frontend Developers, Backend Engineers, DevOps, etc.
- **Interactive Code Examples**: Embedded code snippets with copy-to-clipboard functionality
- **Demo Environment Integration**: Seamless connection to practice repositories and sandbox environments
- **Progress Tracking**: User journey mapping to optimize feature adoption funnel

### Success Metrics

- Feature adoption rates post-course completion
- Time-to-implementation for new integrations
- User progression through learning paths
- Conversion from basic error tracking to advanced feature usage

### Key Highlights of the Brief:

Strategic Positioning: Frames Sentry Academy as a "feature adoption engine disguised as a
learning platform" - making the business objective clear while maintaining the educational
experience.

Target Audience: Clearly defines primary (current Sentry users using only error tracking) and
secondary (new users) audiences with specific pain points.
Content Strategy: Details the comprehensive content structure you outlined:

- Intro videos and feature descriptions
- Real-world scenarios and implementation code
- Customer case studies and UI examples
- Demo repositories for hands-on practice

Learning Experience: Covers both traditional course cards and interactive learning paths that
consider user roles and suggest next features to enable.

Technical Foundation: Outlines the React/TypeScript architecture with Tailwind CSS that
matches your current project setup.

Success Metrics: Includes measurable outcomes tied to feature adoption,
time-to-implementation, and user progression.
