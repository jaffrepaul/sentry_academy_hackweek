# Sentry Account Connection User Flow Plan

## Overview

Design a user-friendly flow for optionally connecting Sentry accounts to enable personalized learning recommendations based on their actual Sentry setup.

## User Flow Options

### Option 1: Progressive Onboarding Flow (Recommended)

1. User signs up/logs in → Standard welcome
2. After completing 1-2 basic courses → Show "Level Up Your Learning" prompt
3. Explain benefits: "Connect your Sentry account to get recommendations based on what you haven't enabled yet"
4. Two connection methods:
   - OAuth (one-click, recommended)
   - Manual auth token (for advanced users)
5. Post-connection: Show personalized dashboard with detected gaps

### Option 2: Profile Enhancement Flow

1. User visits profile/settings
2. "Enhanced Learning" section shows connection status
3. Clear value proposition with before/after examples
4. Connection process with real-time validation
5. Immediate feedback showing detected features

### Option 3: Smart Prompt Flow

1. User browses generic courses
2. Smart banner: "Want courses tailored to YOUR Sentry setup?"
3. Click triggers modal explaining benefits
4. Quick connection process
5. Page refreshes with personalized recommendations

## Implementation Components

### 1. Value Proposition Component

- Clear explanation of benefits
- Screenshots showing before/after experience
- Privacy assurance messaging
- "Skip for now" option always available

### 2. Connection Method Selection

- OAuth button (primary, easiest)
- Manual token input (secondary, for power users)
- Help documentation for both methods

### 3. Token Setup Instructions

- Step-by-step Sentry UI screenshots
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality for settings URLs
- Token format validation with helpful error messages
- Scope explanation (what permissions we need and why)

### 4. Post-Connection Experience

- Immediate feedback showing connected organizations
- Preview of personalized recommendations
- Settings to disconnect or manage connection
- Regular sync status updates

### 5. Personalization Dashboard

- "Your Sentry Setup" overview
- "Recommended Next Steps" based on missing features
- "Courses for Your Stack" filtered by detected platforms
- Progress tracking with Sentry feature adoption

## Technical Implementation

### API Routes Required:

1. /api/sentry/oauth - Initiate OAuth flow
2. /api/sentry/callback - Handle OAuth callback
3. /api/sentry/validate-token - Validate manual auth tokens
4. /api/sentry/disconnect - Remove connection
5. /api/sentry/sync - Refresh organization data
6. /api/recommendations - Get personalized recommendations

### Database Schema:

- sentry_connections table (already designed)
- User preferences for recommendation frequency
- Tracking of recommended vs completed features

### UI Components:

- SentryConnection component (already created)
- PersonalizedRecommendations component
- SetupGapAnalysis component
- FeatureAdoptionProgress component

### Environment Variables:

```
SENTRY_CLIENT_ID=your_oauth_app_id
SENTRY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_oauth_app_secret
ENCRYPTION_KEY=for_token_encryption
```

## User Experience Flow Details

### Phase 1: Introduction

- Show value without requiring connection
- Use compelling copy: "See what Sentry features you're missing"
- Include social proof: "Join 500+ developers getting personalized recommendations"

### Phase 2: Connection Choice

- Primary CTA: "Connect with OAuth" (purple gradient button)
- Secondary: "Use Auth Token" (outlined button)
- Tertiary: "Skip for now" (text link)

### Phase 3: OAuth Flow

1. Click "Connect with OAuth"
2. Redirect to Sentry with proper scopes
3. User authorizes in Sentry
4. Redirect back with success message
5. Show immediate analysis of their setup

### Phase 4: Manual Token Flow

1. Click "Use Auth Token"
2. Show step-by-step instructions with screenshots
3. Input field with real-time validation
4. Test connection and show results
5. Save and show analysis

### Phase 5: Post-Connection Value

- Dashboard showing: "Your org has 3 projects but only 1 uses Performance Monitoring"
- Specific recommendations: "Enable Session Replay on your React app"
- Estimated impact: "Reduce debugging time by 40%"

## Privacy and Security

### Data Handling:

- Only read-only access (org:read, project:read scopes)
- Encrypted token storage
- Regular token rotation for OAuth
- Clear data deletion options

### User Control:

- Granular permissions display
- One-click disconnect
- Data export options
- Audit log of API calls

### Compliance:

- GDPR-compliant data handling
- SOC 2 Type II security standards
- Regular security audits
- Transparent privacy policy

## Measuring Success

### Key Metrics:

- Connection rate (% of users who connect)
- Feature adoption rate (% who implement recommendations)
- Course completion rate (connected vs non-connected users)
- Time to value (days from connection to feature implementation)
- User satisfaction scores

### A/B Testing:

- Different value proposition messaging
- OAuth vs token preference
- Timing of connection prompts
- Recommendation frequency

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (MVP):

1. Basic OAuth flow
2. Organization/project detection
3. Simple recommendations based on missing features
4. Connection management UI

### Phase 2 (Enhanced):

1. Manual token option
2. Advanced feature detection (performance, replays, etc.)
3. Personalized learning paths
4. Progress tracking integration

### Phase 3 (Advanced):

1. Real-time sync
2. Smart notifications
3. Team sharing features
4. Advanced analytics

## Error Handling

### Common Scenarios:

- Invalid tokens
- Expired OAuth grants
- Network timeouts
- Rate limiting
- Scope changes

### User Experience:

- Graceful degradation to generic content
- Clear error messages with next steps
- Retry mechanisms
- Support contact options

_This integration transforms Sentry Academy from a traditional learning platform into an intelligent feature adoption assistant that understands each user's specific setup and guides them toward high-impact improvements they didn't know they needed._
