# AI-Powered Learning Experience Streamlining Plan

## Brief Description

Transform Sentry Academy from a static, role-based learning platform into an intelligent, adaptive learning experience that leverages AI to streamline user onboarding, personalize content delivery, and optimize learning paths based on user behavior and existing Sentry configuration.

## Core Principle Implementation

## Algorithm Implementation

### Smart Persona Detection Algorithm
1. **Input**: Sentry API data, tech stack signals, SDK usage patterns
2. **Logic**:
   - Analyze Sentry project configuration and SDK integrations
   - Parse error patterns and performance monitoring usage
   - Apply ML classification model to predict role with confidence score
   - Cross-reference with user-provided hints (if any)
3. **Output**: Predicted persona with confidence percentage and reasoning

### Conversational Learning Assistant Algorithm
1. **Input**: User question, current course context, learning progress, persona
2. **Logic**:
   - Build context prompt with current learning state and persona
   - Include relevant course content and user's progress as context
   - Generate response using OpenAI API with structured prompts
   - Maintain conversation history for continuity
3. **Output**: Contextual response with actionable next steps and learning guidance

### Adaptive Content Personalization Algorithm
1. **Input**: Base content, user persona, tech stack, progress patterns
2. **Logic**:
   - Analyze user's demonstrated knowledge level from completion patterns
   - Generate persona-specific explanations with their tech stack context
   - Adapt complexity based on user's success rate and time spent
   - Include real-world examples relevant to their specific use case
3. **Output**: Personalized content with adapted explanations and examples

### Learning Path Optimization Algorithm
1. **Input**: User progress data, struggle points, completion times, learning style
2. **Logic**:
   - Identify patterns in user's learning behavior and preferences
   - Detect knowledge gaps from incomplete modules or long completion times
   - Recommend path modifications (skip, reorder, or add supplementary content)
   - A/B test different path variations to optimize success rates
3. **Output**: Optimized learning path with reasoning for modifications
